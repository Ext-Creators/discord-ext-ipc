# A how-to guide

Next steps:

 - Go to [Read the docs dashboard](https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/)
 - Import a project
 - Import the `discord.ext.ipc` repo
 - Setup your sub-domain
 - Enjoy the automated documentation!

(Read the docs importing was down at time of writing, 
so cannot do more a more detailed guide.
Feel free to ask me however, and I can help out)
