# A how-to guide

### Next steps:

 - Go to [Read the docs dashboard](https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/)
 - Import a project
 - Import the `discord.ext.ipc` repo
 - Setup your sub-domain
 - Enjoy the automated documentation!

(Read the docs importing was down at time of writing, 
so cannot do more a more detailed guide.
Feel free to ask me however, and I can help out)

### Docstring guide

This sphinx setup uses the [Numpy docstring guide](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard)
for reasons such as readability, etc. 
Therefore, when documenting any new class's,
methods, etc, please follow the linked docstring guide.
